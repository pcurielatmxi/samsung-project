You are a quality reviewer for document extraction. Your task is to review and correct the extraction output below.

## EXTRACTION OUTPUT TO REVIEW
{output_content}

## REVIEW TASK

Carefully review the extraction output and fix any issues you find:

1. **Accuracy**: Correct any misread values, dates, numbers, or identifiers
2. **Completeness**: Fill in any obviously missing fields that can be inferred from context
3. **Consistency**: Ensure data types are correct (dates are dates, numbers are numbers)
4. **Formatting**: Fix any formatting issues (extra whitespace, inconsistent casing, etc.)
5. **No Hallucinations**: Do NOT add information that isn't clearly implied by the existing data

## OUTPUT

Return the corrected extraction in the same format as the input. If no corrections are needed, return the input unchanged.

Important:
- Preserve all field names and structure
- Only make changes where there are clear issues
- Do not remove data unless it's clearly erroneous
- When in doubt, preserve the original value
