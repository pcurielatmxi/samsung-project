## Detailed Timeline

### 2022-08-21 — Project kickoff - FAB stability and SUP sequencing concerns

**Scope Changes:**
- Roof deck sequence changed - deck must be poured prior to waffles and DT precast
- Truss fireproofing method decision pending - significant schedule impact potential
- Walkable ceiling integrated design concerns raised

**Delays/Issues:**
- FAB Building stability without SUP Buildings being erected first

---

### 2022-09-04 — Precast design issues emerging, SUP Building foundations

**Scope Changes:**
- Waffle slab clearance design issues being resolved
- SUP 1 and SUP 2 foundation designs progressing

**Delays/Issues:**
- Precast subcontractor constraints becoming apparent

---

### 2022-10-16 — Precast fabrication constraints, design changes accumulating

**Scope Changes:**
- Waffle slab clearance issues came to light
- Column issues from Jacobs Review with corbel heights
- Upper columns at Fab pending design
- Laydown areas and crane access still being finalized with SECAI

**Delays/Issues:**
- Precast fabrication production holding up erection
- Goal dates slipping for G-Columns, Girders, E-Line

---

### 2023-01-23 — Major acceleration effort, HEI engagement, production rate increases

**Scope Changes:**
- Support Buildings design changing due to equipment loads
- Schedule sent to Tindall disregarding fabrication production rates
- FIZ precast columns - drawings not yet issued for approval

**Delays/Issues:**
- HEI repairing and recasting columns - numerous FAB columns not yet released
- SUP's C&L Columns - erection waiting for fabrication production since start
- Tindal, Coreslab, Gate, HEI novation issues due to production problems

**Production:**
- Raker waffle fabrication boosted from 6/wk to 15-18/wk
- Erection production = 12/wk (North and South)
- 6 Rakers onsite - 1 installed

---

### 2023-03-06 — SUP roof IFC drawings released, DT slabs starting

**Scope Changes:**
- SUP Roof: IFC Drawings released for both SUE and SUW
- Tindall generating shop tickets
- DT slabs and raker slabs work starting as areas available

**Delays/Issues:**
- NCRs #10 and #21 resolved - closure pending
- HEI requested prioritization of FAB and FIZ columns

---

### 2023-03-13 — FIZ RETROFIT DECISION - Major scope change

**Scope Changes:**
- *** FIZ Steel: SECAI/SAS made decision to retrofit ***
- Awaiting final design of retrofit
- SUP roof delay - exploring L3 decks while waiting for L4 roof beams

**Delays/Issues:**
- Still awaiting final retrofit design
- L4 roof beams still pending

---

### 2023-04-03 — Interior subcontractors mobilizing, interiors budget emerging

**Scope Changes:**
- Subcontracting: Patriot, W&W Erection, BERG Drywall, FD Thomas (intumescent)
- AFCO novated package
- Doors & Hardware package
- Buck hoist - Lewis & Crane
- Interiors budget being established

---

### 2023-05-22 — Interior finishes scope elaboration

**Scope Changes:**
- Drywall and insulation scope progressing
- Interior finish work packages being defined

---

## Scope Growth Correlation with Schedule Versions

| Schedule Date | Tasks | Growth | Key Contemporaneous Events |
|---------------|-------|--------|---------------------------|
| 2022-10-10 | 840 | — | Precast fabrication constraints emerging |
| 2022-11-07 | 1,053 | +25% | SUP Building designs not finalized |
| 2023-01-30 | 1,805 | +35% | Acceleration effort, HEI engagement, design changes |
| 2023-03-26 | 2,299 | +27% | **FIZ Retrofit Decision**, SUP IFC released |
| 2023-06-18 | 2,712 | +18% | Interior subcontractors mobilizing |

## Key Insight

The weekly reports document the **progressive elaboration** of scope from a summary-level baseline to a detailed execution schedule:

1. **Aug-Oct 2022:** FAB structural work was primary focus; SUP Buildings not yet detailed
2. **Nov-Dec 2022:** Precast fabrication constraints drove schedule acceleration efforts
3. **Jan 2023:** Major acceleration with multiple fabricators (HEI, Tindall, Coreslab)
4. **Mar 2023:** FIZ Retrofit decision fundamentally changed structural steel scope
5. **Apr-Jun 2023:** Interior trades mobilized, introducing significant new scope categories

**The schedule growth from 840 to 2,712 tasks reflects scope maturation, not project expansion.**
