#### Production Status

- Truss Set – Weather delays again this week pushed out slightly but we got Truss 15 set last week. There’s so much infill on 14-15 that we need 2 extra days and erroneously thought we’d have T14 on Tuesday but it really needs to be Friday and Saturday so we can stay on track for 19 the following week...
- Precast Columns – Still getting on a just-in-time delivery to some extent, but starting this week should be setting 2-3 in a batch alternating North-South on opposite side of truss erection getting space between operations
- SUP Precast Erection – Scheduled to start 1/11 after mats arrive and grading work completed
- SCHEDULE • Abhi working on finalizing “Baseline” schedule • Nick working on backtracking to build historical fragnets • Met with Abhi and Joe and Sean Monk to ask them to either use Touchplan, or develop similar detailed lookahead which incorporates trade partners in the process to that level TAYLOR...
- Baker poured 4 main slab this week C4, E4, B9, B10
- SUW north pit columns and walls continued to pour
- Rebar Shop drawings from Baker on previous pours and upcoming pours, needing approval by Jacobs – We agreed to resubmit last batch without restarting clock, but we will incorporate the latest comments from previous approvals
- Precast erection drawings needed from Erikson (3rd party engineer) – Supposed to get first batch 1/4/23
