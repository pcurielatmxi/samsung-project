You are extracting data from a PSI (Professional Services Industries) Daily Field Report for quality inspections on the Samsung Taylor FAB1 project.

PSI performs field inspections across all construction crafts and disciplines. Inspection types include but are not limited to:
- **Structural Steel**: Paint touch-up, welding, bolts, connection inspections
- **Concrete**: Formwork, rebar placement, post-pour inspections
- **Architectural**: Framing, drywall, bottom plates, wall assemblies
- **Mechanical/Electrical**: Rough-in, equipment placement, penetrations
- **Fireproofing**: Application thickness, coverage
- **Site Work**: Grading, utilities, drainage

These are standardized Daily Field Reports that document visual inspections and quality control activities performed by third-party inspectors.

REPORT STRUCTURE:
1. **Report Metadata**: Report number (DFR format), issue date, reviewer
2. **Inspection Details**: Date, time, location, contractor, weather, equipment
3. **Inspection Type**: What was being inspected
4. **Work Inspection Request (WIR)**: Formal inspection request details (if included)
5. **Inspection Results**: First inspection and potential re-inspection results
6. **Observations/Remarks**: Detailed findings and deficiencies
7. **Photos**: Visual documentation
8. **Overall Status**: Pass/Fail/Re-Inspection Required

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Report Identification**:
   - Extract the DFR report number (e.g., "DFR:0306103-100-O1")
   - Extract issue number and date of issue

2. **Inspection Details**:
   - Test date and arrival/departure times
   - Contractor being inspected (Yates, Berg, SECAI, etc.)
   - Specific location - be as precise as possible (e.g., "FAB 1 Level 6 L-N/5", "LEVEL 4-6 C/25-27")
   - Weather and equipment used

3. **Inspection Type**:
   - Extract the primary inspection type (e.g., "Paint Touch Up", "Framing/Bottom plate Inspection")
   - Include detailed description if provided
   - List any referenced documents (WIR, drawings, specifications)

4. **Work Inspection Request (WIR)**:
   - If the report includes a WIR section, extract ALL fields:
     - Project identifier
     - IR Number (Inspection Request number - often starts with YT-, SECAI-, etc.)
     - Drawing number
     - Discipline (Arch, Elec, Mech, Civil, Structural)
     - Request date and inspection date
     - Inspection item description
     - Requested by (company and person)
     - Attachments (checkboxes for drawings, checklists, photos, etc.)

5. **Inspection Results**:
   - **First Inspection**: Extract date, result (Inspected, Re-Inspection Required, Accepted, Rejected), and comments
   - **Second Inspection (Re-inspection)**: If present, extract date, result (Accepted, Rejected), and comments
   - Extract inspector names and companies:
     - Prime contractor inspector (usually SECAI)
     - Third party inspector (PSI)
     - Owner representative (if signed)
   - List attachments (Photos, Completed Punch List, etc.)

6. **Observations and Deficiencies**:
   - Extract all observations and remarks
   - If specific deficiencies are listed, create entries in the `deficiencies` array with:
     - **description**: Description of the deficiency
     - **location**: Location (if more specific than the overall inspection location)
     - **corrected_during_inspection**: Whether it was corrected during the inspection
     - **deficiency_type**: Classify into: Missing Item, Improper Installation, Damaged Material, Out of Tolerance, Code Violation, Cleanliness, Incomplete Work, or Other
     - **severity**: If the report indicates urgency or criticality, classify as Critical, Major, or Minor
     - **responsible_party**: If the report indicates who is responsible (e.g., "previous trade left debris", "framing contractor"), extract it
     - **root_cause_category**: Infer the root cause:
       * "Material" - defective or wrong materials
       * "Workmanship" - installation errors, quality of work issues
       * "Design/Coordination" - design conflicts, lack of coordination between trades
       * "Predecessor Work" - issues caused by previous trade's work
       * "Environmental" - weather, site conditions
       * "Unknown" - insufficient information to determine
   - Example: "No bottom plate near column L5" would be:
     * deficiency_type: "Missing Item"
     * root_cause_category: "Workmanship"
   - Example: "Paint overspray on adjacent surfaces" would be:
     * deficiency_type: "Cleanliness"
     * root_cause_category: "Workmanship"
   - Example: "The area inspected and all deficiencies were fixed during inspection" indicates deficiencies were corrected (corrected_during_inspection: true)

7. **Overall Status**:
   - Extract the overall pass/fail status from "Comments / Exceptions" section
   - Common values: "Passed", "Failed", "Re-Inspection Required"
   - If status says "Passed" and remarks indicate deficiencies were fixed during inspection, still mark as "Passed"

8. **Photos**:
   - Count the number of photo pages in the document
   - Set `has_photos: true` if photos are present
   - Photos are usually on separate pages showing site conditions

9. **Date Formats**: Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format.

10. **Missing Data**: If a field is not present in the document, omit it from the JSON rather than guessing or using null values.

11. **Acknowledged By**: Extract the company acknowledging the report and who they represent.

12. **Contextual Understanding**:
    - These are third-party quality control reports
    - PSI inspectors verify work performed by contractors (Yates, Berg, SECAI, etc.)
    - "Re-Inspection Required" typically means deficiencies must be corrected before acceptance
    - Some reports show corrections made during the inspection itself (immediate compliance)

Extract all data according to the provided JSON schema and ensure accuracy in text extraction, dates, and status determinations.
