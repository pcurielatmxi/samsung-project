## Background
Following the pattern established by CO-01 and CO-02, Yates submitted a third change order package in February 2025. This submission was notable for being the first to include formal expert schedule analysis from Berkeley Research Group (BRG), establishing the foundation for delay attribution claims.

## BRG Preliminary Expert Report
The February 2025 submission included a Preliminary Expert Report from BRG analyzing schedule delays using the "contemporaneous period" methodology. Key findings supported Yates' position that SECAI-caused delays were responsible for project slippage.

### Methodology
- Contemporaneous Period Analysis per AACE RP 29R-03
- Review of monthly P6 schedule updates
- Critical path analysis from update to update
- Attribution of delay to responsible party

## Key Dates & Milestones

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Feb 10, 2025 | EOT-03 and PCCO-03 submitted |
| Feb 28, 2025 | BRG Preliminary Report finalized |
| ~May 2025 | CO-03 executed |

## Parties Involved
- **Contractor:** W.G. Yates & Sons Construction Company

## Impact on Analysis

### Schedule Data (P6)
- BRG analysis based on P6 schedule updates through January 2025
- Critical path analysis can be validated against P6 driving path data
- Delay periods identified should align with P6 activity slippage

### Labor Hours (ProjectSight, TBM)
- Continued GC extension implies labor consumption analysis needed
- Trade contractor claims indicate rework and additional scope

### Quality Metrics
- Stair 21 reinstallation indicates potential quality/coordination issue
- Multiple RFI-driven scope changes suggest design coordination issues

## Notes
- First EOT submission with formal expert schedule analysis
- Established BRG as Yates' delay analysis expert
- Set precedent for the more comprehensive EOT-04 submission
- SECAI's review of this submission informed the April 28, 2025 EOT meeting
