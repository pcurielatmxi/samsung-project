# Elevator Delays & Disputes

**Status:** Under Investigation
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-13

This document consolidates all elevator-related delays, claims, and disputes between Yates and SECAI on the Taylor FAB1 project. Elevator delays are a key contested area where SECAI disputes the attribution.

---

## Executive Summary

Per the BRG Expert Report (August 2025), elevator-related delays account for **203+ days** on the critical path, predominantly attributed to SECAI. SECAI disputes this attribution, particularly around:
- Elevator 1B concurrency analysis
- Scope boundary definitions (edge armor, door frames)
- Design coordination responsibilities

## Elevator-Specific Issues

### Elevator #1 & #1A (Freight)

**Delay Period:** Periods 12, 14 (159 days combined)

**Timeline:**
| Date | Event | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| 6/16/25 | Scheduled start pushed back due to MEP conflicts | Schedule Narrative |
| 7/10/25 | Official Delay Notice issued | EXHIBIT_32 |
| 8/18/25 | Original turnover date | Schedule Narrative |
| 8/21/25 | SECAI revised turnover to 9/5 (2-3 week delay) | Schedule Narrative |
| 8/25/25 | Gap measurements corrected | Schedule Narrative |

**Issues:**
- MEP out-of-sequence installs (cable trays, piping) blocking Berg drywall
- 5" threshold specification conflict (RFIs May & Sept 2025 unresolved)
- SECAI directive (Sept 15, 2023) to procure doors before shop drawings

**Yates Claim:**
> "Over 5 months of delay with shifting conditions and no clear handover"
> — *Official Delay Notice, July 10, 2025*

| 5/9-5/16/25 | Constraints reported at multiple levels | Schedule Narrative |
| 8/23/24-10/17/24 | SECAI hold preventing Yates work | BRG Report |

**Issues:**
- SECAI installing door jambs (not Yates scope per RFI)
- Pending RFI response on wall thickness issue
- Period 8 shows 11 days potentially Yates-attributable (disputed)

## BRG Expert Opinion

> "SECAI's construction of the elevators, which restrained Yates' follow-on elevator framing and related work, was a total disaster throughout 2024 and well into 2025. SECAI was substantially late with its elevator construction."

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### P6 Schedule Data

**838 unique elevator task codes** identified across all P6 snapshots.

#### Turnover Task Progression (SECAI Dependency Indicator)

*Source: P6 task.csv, "TURNOVER" or "AWAIT COMPLETION" tasks*

| Elevator | Jan 10 | Feb 21 | Apr 4 | May 23 | Actual Complete |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **01** | -471d float | -516d float | +6d (reset) | Active | May 30, 2025 |
| **01A** | -480d float | -500d float | +132d (reset) | Complete | Feb 17, 2025 |
| **01B** | Complete | Complete | Complete | Complete | Jun 4, 2024 |
| **22** | -499d float | -544d float | 0d (reset) | Complete | Apr 28, 2025 |

**Key Findings:**
- Elevators 01, 01A, 22 showed **massive negative float** (400-550 days) in Jan-Feb 2025
- Schedule was **re-baselined in April 2025** bringing float back to near-zero
- This confirms BRG's assertion that Periods 12-14 (Feb-May 2025) were critical path elevator delays
- Elevator 01B turnover completed June 2024, but BRG cites Period 7 (Aug-Oct 2024) hold - different scope

#### Sample Incomplete Tasks (Feb 21, 2025 Schedule)

**Elevator 22 - 13 incomplete tasks:**
| Status | Float | Task |
|--------|-------|------|
| TK_Active | -544d | ELEVATOR TURNOVER TO SECAI / AWAIT ELEVATOR COMPLETION |
| TK_Active | -432d | IMPACT - E4 MEP MATERIAL EQUIPMENT IN WAY |
| TK_NotStart | -544d | TAPE & FLOAT - INTERIOR SHAFT & DOOR FRONTS |
| TK_NotStart | -544d | COMPLETE REMAINING HSS STEEL DOOR OPENINGS |
| TK_NotStart | -525d | SECAI - INSTALL ELEVATOR DOOR FRAMES |

*The "AWAIT ELEVATOR COMPLETION" and "SECAI - INSTALL" tasks confirm Yates dependency on SECAI work.*

### Quality Data (RABA/PSI)

| Other | 46 | 0 | - | - |

#### Failure Categories

*MXI analysis - categorized from inspection descriptions*

| Category | Count | % | Typical Cause |
|----------|-------|---|---------------|
| Drywall defects | 34 | 39% | Joint compound, taping, gaps |
| Shaft wall defects | 22 | 25% | Surface preparation, damage |
| Coating/FRM issues | 18 | 20% | Holidays, rust, damaged coating |
| Fireproofing | 9 | 10% | Thickness, coverage |

#### Key Observations

1. **Berg (drywall subcontractor)** performed all elevator shaft work - 100% of failures attributed to Berg
2. **Elevator 01** had the highest failure count (26 total) - aligns with BRG Period 12/14 delays (159 days)
3. **Coating/FRM issues** (20% of failures) correlate with oil contamination issues cited in delay claims
4. **Failure rate spike** in Feb-Mar 2025 coincides with the 93-day Period 12 delay

#### ProjectSight - Berg Labor Hours

*Note: ProjectSight lacks location detail; Berg hours shown as proxy for elevator shaft work*

**Berg Total Hours (2022-2025):** 836,393 hours (107,441 entries)

**Berg Hours During Disputed Period (Jan-May 2025):**

| Month | Hours | Context |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Jan 2025 | 16,110 | Pre-Period 12 |
| Feb 2025 | 22,766 | Period 12 starts (Feb 21) |

| May 2025 | 25,481 | Period 14 ends (May 2) |
| **Total** | **88,121** | |

#### Key Observations

1. **Elevator 01** consumed the most labor (702 worker-days) - consistent with 159-day delay attribution
2. **May 2025** shows labor spike (929 worker-days in TBM, 25K hours in ProjectSight) suggesting acceleration to complete
3. **Berg dominates** elevator shaft work (38% of worker-days) - all quality failures attributed to Berg
4. **MK Marlow** significant presence (22% of worker-days) - elevator installer coordination
5. **Cherry Coatings** involvement (4%) correlates with coating/FRM inspection failures

## Rework Hours Attribution

*MXI analysis - estimated rework hours from documented quality failures*

### Methodology

Two approaches were evaluated:

1. **Rework Window Analysis** - Sum labor hours in 7-day window after each failure
   - Limitation: TBM data lacks precise elevator-level matching
   - Result: ~41,000 hours (likely overstated due to generic matching)

2. **Category-Based Estimate (RECOMMENDED)** - Apply industry-standard rework hours per failure type
   - More conservative and traceable to specific failures
   - Based on documented quality failures with categorized defect types

### Category-Based Rework Estimate

| Failure Category | Failures | Hours/Failure | Total Hours |
|------------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Drywall | 7 | 16 | 112 |
| Coating | 11 | 12 | 132 |
| Framing | 22 | 20 | 440 |
| Finish | 3 | 8 | 24 |
| Default | 64 | 16 | 1,024 |
| **TOTAL** | **107** | | **1,732** |

### Rework by Period

| Period | Failures | Rework Hours | Notes |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------|
| 2024 | 11 | 172 | Period 7-8 (Elevator 1B hold) |
| Jan-May 2025 | 19 | 268 | **Periods 12-14 (Disputed)** |
| Jun-Dec 2025 | 77 | 1,292 | Post-dispute completion |

### Context

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Elevator Labor (TBM) | 50,440 hours |
| Estimated Direct Rework | 1,732 hours |
| Rework as % of Total | 3.4% |
| Disputed Period Rework | 268 hours |

### Assumptions

*Industry standard rework hours per failure type:*
- Drywall defects: 16 hours (2 crew-days)
- Coating/paint: 12 hours (1.5 crew-days)
- Fireproofing: 24 hours (3 crew-days)
- Framing: 20 hours (2.5 crew-days)
- Finish work: 8 hours (1 crew-day)

*Excluded from estimate:*
- Supervision/oversight hours
- Material procurement delays
- Re-inspection wait time
- Cascading delays to other trades
