## Impact on Analysis

### Schedule Data (P6)
- BRG analysis based on P6 updates through January 2025
- Critical path methodology validated against contemporaneous schedules
- Establishes baseline for subsequent delay attribution

### Labor Hours (ProjectSight, TBM)
- Continued GC extension implies labor consumption analysis needed
- Expert analysis period covers labor through early 2025

### Quality Metrics
- Moisture resistant board issues referenced in exhibits
- Review quality data for correlation with claimed delays

## Notes
- First EOT with formal expert analysis
- Established BRG methodology for EOT-04
- SECAI contact changed from Haewan Lee to Deog-Gyu Seo
- Preliminary nature - full report reserved for EOT-04
- Successfully incorporated into executed CO-03
