## Key Claims by Yates

### Contractual Position
1. Yates is contractually entitled to time extensions and GC compensation
2. No Yates concurrent delays exist
3. SECAI bears sole responsibility for:
   - MEP coordination under SECAI's control
   - Control of all Trade Contractors
   - Preparation and adherence to unified consolidated project schedule

### Evidence Basis
- Over 1,000 fragnets identifying project delays in contemporaneous Yates schedule
- Weekly constraint logs
- BRG forensic schedule analysis using contemporaneous period methodology
- Monthly schedule narratives documenting delays

### Disputed Items
- Waffle coating responsibility (referenced in BRG Report pp. 109-115)
- Elevator 1B concurrency analysis
- GL33 coordination delays

## Impact on Integrated Analysis

### Schedule Data (P6)
- Critical path delays from BRG report can be validated against P6 snapshots
- Delay periods align with monthly schedule update data dates
- Elevator, stair tower, and coordination delays visible in P6 activity variances

### Labor Hours (ProjectSight, TBM)
- General Conditions compensation claims indicate extended site overhead
- Labor consumption during claimed delay periods should be analyzed
- Compare claimed delays with actual labor on affected areas/trades

### Quality Metrics (RABA, PSI)
- Waffle coating issues referenced in EOT claims
- Elevator installation quality inspections
- MEP coordination issues may correlate with quality failures
