### Analysis Methodology
- **Method:** Contemporaneous Period Analysis (AACE RP 29R-03)
- **Definition:** "Observational technique since it does not involve the insertion or deletion of delays, but instead is based on observing the behavior of the network from update to update and measuring schedule variances based on unaltered, existing logic models"
- **Schedules Analyzed:** Through July 16, 2025 Yates schedule update

## Yates' Key Claims

1. **Contractual Entitlement:** Time extensions and GC compensation
2. **No Concurrent Delays:** Yates claims zero concurrent delays
3. **SECAI Responsibility:**
   - MEP coordination under SECAI's control (per Exhibit M)
   - Control of all Trade Contractors
   - Preparation and adherence to unified consolidated project schedule
4. **Schedule Evidence:** Over 1,000 fragnets in contemporaneous schedule

## Disputed Items

### Waffle Coating Issue
- Discussed in BRG Report pp. 109-115
- Responsibility disputed between parties
- Impact: Recoating required but not critical path per BRG

### Elevator 1B Concurrency
- Full concurrency credited during critical/near-critical period
- Once critical path shifted to door changes, ceased to be concurrent
- Detailed in BRG Report

### GL33 Issues
- Shaft wall framing
- Drywall scope (IOCC-473, IOCC-829, IOCC-609)
- Multiple revision submissions with SECAI comments

## Impact on Analysis

### Schedule Data (P6)
- BRG analysis covers all P6 updates through July 2025
- Critical path analysis can be validated against P6 driving path
- Delay periods align with schedule update data dates
- Elevator, stair tower, and coordination delays visible in P6

### Labor Hours (ProjectSight, TBM)
- GC compensation claim indicates extended site overhead
- Analyze labor consumption during claimed delay periods
- Compare Yates labor vs trade contractor labor by period

### Quality Metrics (RABA, PSI)
- Waffle coating inspections
- Elevator installation quality records
- GL33 area quality issues
- Coordination failures may correlate with inspection failures

## Notes
- Most comprehensive submission to date
- Pending SECAI execution
- Sets total project cost at ~$275.6M
- BRG report provides detailed forensic analysis
- Yates claims no concurrent delays exist
