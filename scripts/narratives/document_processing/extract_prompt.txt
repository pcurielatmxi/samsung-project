You are analyzing project documents for a forensic schedule delay analysis of the Samsung Taylor FAB1 construction project. Extract all information that could help understand what happened, when, why, and who was involved.

## DOCUMENT SUMMARY

Provide a thorough summary of the document covering:
- Document type and purpose
- Date of document and any schedule data date referenced
- Main topics, issues, and events discussed
- Key decisions, directions, or outcomes
- Overall status or conclusions

Be comprehensive. The summary should capture the essential content so someone could understand the document without reading the original.

## RELEVANT STATEMENTS

Extract every statement relevant to understanding project performance: delays, impacts, issues, directions, scope changes, quality problems, coordination issues, progress, commitments, or disputed items.

**CRITICAL: USE VERBATIM QUOTES**
Each statement MUST be copied exactly as written in the document - word for word, character for character. This is required for source traceability. Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, or reword. Copy the exact text.

For each statement provide:
- Statement: **VERBATIM QUOTE** - copy the exact text from the document (required for traceability)
- Date: Date of event if mentioned
- Parties: Companies, contractors, or individuals involved
- Location: Building, area, grid reference if mentioned (FAB, SUE, SUW, FIZ, GL, Level, etc.)
- Impact: Any quantified impact (days, weeks, costs, quantities)
- Notes: Any additional context such as references to other documents, conditions, or assumptions

Use a simple list format. Omit fields that have no relevant information rather than writing "N/A" or "Not stated".

## GUIDELINES

- Extract ALL potentially relevant statements - when in doubt, include it
- **USE EXACT VERBATIM QUOTES** - copy text exactly as written for source traceability
- Do NOT paraphrase, reword, or summarize the statement text
- Include progress and status updates that provide context
- Include conditional statements and assumptions
- Include items noted as "not accounted for" or disputed
- Do not interpret or infer beyond what is stated
- If a statement has multiple parts or sub-points, include them all
- Preserve original punctuation, capitalization, and spelling (even if incorrect)
