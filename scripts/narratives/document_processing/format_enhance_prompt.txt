You are reviewing and improving a formatted forensic schedule delay extraction. The initial formatting may have categorization errors, missing data, or incomplete structured fields.

## REVIEW AND ENHANCE

Carefully review the JSON output and improve it by:

### 1. Document Metadata
- Is the document **type** correctly classified?
  - schedule_narrative: P6 narratives, schedule updates
  - milestone_variance: Milestone tracking reports
  - meeting_minutes: Meeting notes
  - official_notice: Formal delay notices, official letters
  - correspondence: Emails, letters, responses
  - exhibit: Legal exhibits
  - report: Analysis or expert reports
- Are **dates** in correct YYYY-MM-DD format?
- Is the **author** the actual originating party?
- Is the **summary** comprehensive?

### 2. Statement Categories
Review each statement's category for accuracy:
- **delay**: Actual schedule delays, slippage, late completion
- **scope_change**: Added work, modifications, change orders, IOCCs, CCDs
- **quality_issue**: Defects, rework, failed inspections
- **safety**: Safety violations, safety incidents, crew removals for safety reasons
- **owner_direction**: Directions from Samsung/SECAI that impacted work
- **progress**: Status updates, completion percentages (neutral, not delay)
- **resource**: Manpower shortages, equipment issues, material delays (NOT safety-related)
- **weather**: Weather-related delays
- **design_issue**: RFI issues, drawing errors, redesigns
- **coordination**: Interface problems between contractors/trades
- **dispute**: Contested items, disagreements, claims, cost disputes
- **commitment**: Promised dates, schedule commitments
- **other**: Only if nothing else fits

### 2b. Remove Noise
Remove statements that are not forensically relevant:
- Date-only entries with no context
- "Comments from X that we responded to" without substance
- Spelling corrections, formatting instructions
- Administrative notes ("Add X to subject line")

### 3. Data Completeness
For each statement, verify:
- **event_date**: Is there a date that should be captured?
- **parties**: Are ALL involved parties listed? (Yates, SECAI, Samsung, subcontractors by name)
- **locations**: Are location references captured? (FAB, SUE, SUW, FIZ, GL-XX, Level X, Area)
- **impact_days**: If a day count is mentioned, is it captured?
- **impact_description**: Other quantified impacts (costs, quantities, durations)
- **references**: Document references (RFI-XXXX, LT-XXXX, IOCC, exhibits)

### 4. Key Dates
Ensure all important dates are in key_dates:
- Milestone dates
- Completion dates
- Baseline dates
- Data dates

### 5. Referenced Documents
Capture all document references in referenced_documents array.
