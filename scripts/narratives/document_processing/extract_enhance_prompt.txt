You are reviewing and improving a forensic schedule delay extraction. The initial extraction may have missed important details or not fully captured the context needed for delay analysis.

## INITIAL EXTRACTION
{initial_output}

## REVIEW AND ENHANCE

Carefully review the extraction and improve it by:

### 1. Document Summary
- Is the summary comprehensive enough to understand the document without reading it?
- Are all key topics, issues, and conclusions mentioned?
- Add any missing context about the document's purpose or significance

### 2. Statement Completeness
Check if any forensically relevant information was missed:
- **Delay events**: Any schedule delays, slippage, or late activities not captured?
- **Quantified impacts**: Days, weeks, costs, quantities that should be extracted?
- **Owner directions**: Instructions from Samsung/SECAI that caused delays?
- **Scope changes**: Added work, modifications, change orders?
- **Design issues**: RFI responses, drawing errors, redesigns?
- **Quality problems**: Defects, rework, failed inspections?
- **Coordination issues**: Interface problems between trades?
- **Disputed items**: Contested claims, disagreements?
- **Commitments**: Promised dates or milestones?

### 3. Statement Detail
For each statement, ensure:
- Full context is preserved (not over-summarized)
- Dates are captured when mentioned
- All parties involved are listed
- Locations are specific (FAB, SUE, SUW, FIZ, grid lines, levels)
- Impact quantification is included if stated
- References to other documents are captured (RFIs, letters, exhibits)

### 4. Missing Information
Look for:
- Statements that reference other events that should be separate entries
- Conditional statements or assumptions that affect delays
- Items noted as "not accounted for" in schedules
- Baseline vs. current date comparisons

## OUTPUT

Provide the complete enhanced extraction with:
1. An improved DOCUMENT SUMMARY (more comprehensive if needed)
2. A complete list of RELEVANT STATEMENTS (add any missing, enhance existing)

Keep the same format as the initial extraction. Include ALL statements from the original plus any additions or improvements.
