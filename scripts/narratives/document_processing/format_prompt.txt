2. A list of RELEVANT STATEMENTS with dates, parties, locations, and impacts

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

- **references**: Referenced documents (RFI-XXXX, LT-XXXX, exhibits, etc.)

### Key Dates
Extract important project dates mentioned:
- Milestone dates
- Baseline dates
- Completion dates
- Data dates

### Referenced Documents
List document references found (RFIs, letters, exhibits, etc.)

## FORMATTING RULES

1. **Dates**: Always use YYYY-MM-DD format. Convert "March 15, 2024" to "2024-03-15"
2. **Null values**: Use null (not empty string) for missing optional fields
3. **Arrays**: Use empty array [] only if the field exists but has no items; use null if not applicable
4. **Preserve detail**: Keep full statement context - don't over-summarize
5. **Category accuracy**: Choose the most specific applicable category
6. **Party names**: Preserve exact names (Yates, SECAI, Samsung, Austin Bridge, etc.)
