Convert the extracted RABA report information into the required JSON structure for analytics and root cause analysis.

Rules:
- Use ONLY information explicitly stated in the extracted content
- Do not infer or fabricate information
- Use null for fields where information is not available
- For outcome: use exactly "PASS", "FAIL", or "PARTIAL" (PARTIAL = some tests passed, some failed)
- For arrays (issues, parties_involved), use empty array [] if none found
- Quote failure reasons and issues directly from the document when possible
- For location: capture ALL location details exactly as stated (building, level, area, grid, coordinates, etc.)

Standardization rules (IMPORTANT - follow exactly):
- Dates: ALWAYS use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2022-08-09", NOT "08/09/2022")
- failure_reason: Use null if outcome is PASS (not "N/A", "Not applicable", or "None")
- corrective_action: Use null if no corrective action mentioned (not "No", "None", or "N/A")
- reinspection_required: Use true, false, or null only (not strings)

Field mapping:
- report_date: The report or test date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- test_type: Type of test performed (e.g., "Compressive Strength", "Soil Compaction")
- location: All location information as a single string
- summary: Brief summary of what was tested and the results
- outcome: "PASS", "FAIL", or "PARTIAL"
- failure_reason: Quote the reason for failure if stated
- issues: Array of {description, severity} for each deficiency found
- parties_involved: Array of {name, role} for testing company, contractor, supplier, inspector
- reinspection_required: true/false if stated, null if not mentioned
- corrective_action: Any corrective actions noted
- test_counts: {total, passed, failed} if counts are specified
