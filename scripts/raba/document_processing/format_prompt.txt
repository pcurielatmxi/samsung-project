Convert the extracted RABA report information into the required JSON structure for analytics and root cause analysis.

The extracted content has two parts:
- PART 1: Free-form document summary with detailed test results, specifications, and context
- PART 2: Structured Q&A answers

Use BOTH parts to build the output schema. For outcome specifically, leverage the full document context.

Rules:
- Extract information from the provided extraction (both Part 1 summary and Part 2 Q&A)
- Use null for fields where information is truly not available across the entire extraction
- For arrays (issues, parties_involved), use empty array [] if none found
- Quote failure reasons and issues directly from the extracted content when possible
- For location: capture ALL location details from the extraction

CRITICAL - Outcome Field (most important):
The extracted content provides detailed context in PART 1 and explicit outcome determination in PART 2.

Key rule: If Part 2 explicitly explains WHY there's no outcome (e.g., "material characterization report does not list pass/fail requirements", "provides data but does not list pass/fail criteria"), respect that and use NULL.

Otherwise, use these signals to determine outcome:

PASS:
  - Document explicitly states "PASS", "PASSED", "ACCEPTABLE", "APPROVED", or similar, OR
  - Part 2 indicates outcome is PASS, OR
  - All test/measurement results shown in Part 1 are explicitly stated as "exceeded" or "exceeding" design specifications, AND Part 2 doesn't say "no pass/fail criteria"

FAIL:
  - Document explicitly states "FAIL", "FAILED", "NOT COMPLETE", "INCOMPLETE", or similar, OR
  - Part 2 indicates outcome is FAIL, OR
  - Any test/measurement explicitly shown as below specification/requirement

PARTIAL:
  - Some tests/measurements in Part 1 met specifications, some did not, OR
  - Deficiencies noted in Part 1 but also noted as corrected/fixed, OR
  - Mixed results clearly stated in Part 2

CANCELLED:
  - Document is a "Trip Charge Report" - inspector arrived but inspection was cancelled
  - Work was not ready for inspection
  - Inspection was cancelled due to failing internal inspection (e.g., "did not pass Yates internal inspection")
  - Document explicitly states inspection was "cancelled", "not performed", or "did not occur"
  - IMPORTANT: CANCELLED means NO inspection occurred. If inspection occurred but failed, use FAIL.

MEASUREMENT:
  - Document is an observation/characterization report without pass/fail criteria
  - Material pickup or delivery receipt (just documenting pickup, no testing)
  - Lab report that provides data but does not list pass/fail requirements or specifications
  - Part 2 explicitly states "N/A" or explains no pass/fail criteria exist
  - Examples: "Length Change" shrinkage tests, concrete pickup reports, observation-only reports

OTHER:
  - Use when document doesn't clearly fit any of the above categories
  - Administrative documents, transmittals, cover sheets without test results
  - Incomplete or corrupted reports where outcome cannot be determined
  - ALWAYS populate outcome_raw with the actual text describing the status/result from the document
  - This allows edge cases to be captured for later review rather than forced into wrong categories

IMPORTANT: Don't override Part 2's explanation. If Part 2 indicates CANCELLED or N/A, respect that classification.

Standardization rules (IMPORTANT - follow exactly):
- Dates: ALWAYS use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2022-08-09", NOT "08/09/2022")
- failure_reason: Use null if outcome is PASS (not "N/A", "Not applicable", or "None")
- corrective_action: Use null if no corrective action mentioned (not "No", "None", or "N/A")
- reinspection_required: Use true, false, or null only (not strings)

Field mapping:
- report_date: The report or test date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- test_type: Type of test performed (e.g., "Compressive Strength", "Soil Compaction")
- location: All location information as a single string
- summary: Brief summary of what was tested and the results
- outcome: "PASS", "FAIL", "PARTIAL", "CANCELLED", "MEASUREMENT", or "OTHER"
- outcome_raw: Original outcome text from document (required if OTHER, optional otherwise for uncertain cases)
- failure_reason: Quote the reason for failure if stated
- issues: Array of {description, severity} for each deficiency found
- parties_involved: Array of {name, role} for testing company, contractor, supplier, inspector
- reinspection_required: true/false if stated, null if not mentioned
- corrective_action: Any corrective actions noted
- test_counts: {total, passed, failed} if counts are specified
