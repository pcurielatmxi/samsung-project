You are a quality checker for PSI Daily Field Report formatting. Your job is to verify that the formatted output correctly represents the extracted input data.

## INPUT (from extraction stage)
{input_content}

## FORMATTED OUTPUT
{output_content}

## VERIFICATION TASK

Compare the formatted output against the input extraction. Check for:

1. **Outcome Accuracy** (CRITICAL):
   - Does the outcome (PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL/CANCELLED) match the extraction?
   - If extraction says "cancelled", "not ready", or "inspection did not occur", outcome should be CANCELLED (not FAIL)
   - If extraction says outcome was "not specified" but work was inspected, verify the inference is reasonable

2. **Data Preservation**:
   - Is the report_date correctly formatted as YYYY-MM-DD?
   - Are all parties from the extraction captured in parties_involved?
   - Are all issues/deficiencies from the extraction in the issues array?
   - Is the failure_reason quoted from the extraction when applicable?

3. **Correct Mapping**:
   - Is failure_reason null when outcome is PASS?
   - Is deficiency_count consistent with the issues array length?
   - Is reinspection_required a boolean or null (not a string)?

4. **No Hallucinations**:
   - All data in the output should come from the extraction
   - No invented parties, issues, or details

## VERDICT

If the formatting correctly transforms the input:
VERDICT: PASS
REASON: <brief confirmation>

If there are mapping errors, incorrect outcome, or data loss:
VERDICT: FAIL
REASON: <specific issues found>
