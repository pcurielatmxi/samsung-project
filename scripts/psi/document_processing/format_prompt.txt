Convert the extracted PSI Daily Field Report information into the required JSON structure for analytics and root cause analysis.

The extracted content has two parts:
- PART 1: Free-form document summary with inspection details, observations, and findings
- PART 2: Structured Q&A answers

Use BOTH parts to build the output schema. For outcome specifically, leverage the full document context.

Rules:
- Extract information from the provided extraction (both Part 1 summary and Part 2 Q&A)
- Use null for fields where information is truly not available across the entire extraction
- For arrays (issues, parties_involved), use empty array [] if none found
- Quote failure reasons and issues directly from the extracted content when possible
- For location: capture ALL location details from the extraction

CRITICAL - Outcome Field (most important):
The extracted content provides detailed inspection findings in PART 1 and explicit outcome determination in PART 2.

Key rule: If Part 2 explicitly explains WHY there's no outcome (e.g., "inspection findings do not specify pass/fail", "no approval status indicated"), respect that and use NULL.

Otherwise, use these signals to determine outcome:

PASS:
  - Document explicitly states "PASS", "PASSED", "ACCEPTABLE", "APPROVED", "Passed", or similar, OR
  - Part 2 indicates outcome is PASS, OR
  - Inspection report clearly describes work as complete, acceptable, meeting requirements with no outstanding deficiencies AND Part 2 doesn't say "outcome not specified"

FAIL:
  - Document explicitly states "FAIL", "FAILED", "NOT COMPLETE", "INCOMPLETE", "Not approved", or similar, OR
  - Part 2 indicates outcome is FAIL, OR
  - Inspection notes deficiencies or non-conformances that were NOT corrected

PARTIAL:
  - Some items/areas passed, some failed OR
  - Deficiencies noted but also noted as corrected during inspection, OR
  - Mixed approval status described

NULL (use when):
  - Part 2 explicitly explains no outcome was determined (e.g., findings don't specify approval, no approval status indicated)
  - No clear inspection determination or approval status anywhere in document
  - Cannot reasonably determine from available data

IMPORTANT: Don't override Part 2's explanation. If Part 2 says outcome is "not specified" with explanation, use NULL rather than inferring.

Standardization rules (IMPORTANT - follow exactly):
- Dates: ALWAYS use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2024-04-29", NOT "4/29/2024")
- failure_reason: Use null if outcome is PASS (not "N/A", "Not applicable", or "None")
- corrective_action: Use null if no corrective action mentioned (not "No", "None", or "N/A")
- reinspection_required: Use true, false, or null only (not strings)
- deficiency_count: Use integer or null only (not 0 if no deficiencies mentioned, use null)

Field mapping:
- report_date: The report date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- inspection_type: Type of inspection (e.g., "Paint Touch Up", "Framing", "Drywall", "MEP")
- location: All location information as a single string
- summary: Brief summary of the inspection and findings
- outcome: "PASS", "FAIL", or "PARTIAL"
- failure_reason: Quote the reason for failure if stated
- issues: Array of {description, severity} for each deficiency found
- parties_involved: Array of {name, role} for inspector, contractor, subcontractor, trade
- reinspection_required: true/false if stated, null if not mentioned
- corrective_action: Any corrective actions noted
- deficiency_count: Number of deficiencies if specified
