Convert the extracted PSI Daily Field Report information into the required JSON structure for analytics and root cause analysis.

Rules:
- Use ONLY information explicitly stated in the extracted content
- Do not infer or fabricate information
- Use null for fields where information is not available
- For outcome: use exactly "PASS", "FAIL", or "PARTIAL" (PARTIAL = some items passed, some failed)
- For arrays (issues, parties_involved), use empty array [] if none found
- Quote failure reasons and issues directly from the document when possible
- For location: capture ALL location details exactly as stated (building, level, area, grid, coordinates, etc.)

Standardization rules (IMPORTANT - follow exactly):
- Dates: ALWAYS use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2024-04-29", NOT "4/29/2024")
- failure_reason: Use null if outcome is PASS (not "N/A", "Not applicable", or "None")
- corrective_action: Use null if no corrective action mentioned (not "No", "None", or "N/A")
- reinspection_required: Use true, false, or null only (not strings)
- deficiency_count: Use integer or null only (not 0 if no deficiencies mentioned, use null)
