Convert the extracted PSI Daily Field Report information into the required JSON structure for analytics and root cause analysis.

The extracted content has two parts:
- PART 1: Free-form document summary with inspection details, observations, and findings
- PART 2: Structured Q&A answers

Use BOTH parts to build the output schema. For outcome specifically, leverage the full document context.

Rules:
- Extract information from the provided extraction (both Part 1 summary and Part 2 Q&A)
- Use null for fields where information is truly not available across the entire extraction
- For arrays (issues, parties_involved), use empty array [] if none found
- Quote failure reasons and issues directly from the extracted content when possible
- For location: capture ALL location details from the extraction

CRITICAL - Outcome Field (most important):
The extracted content provides detailed inspection findings in PART 1 and explicit outcome determination in PART 2.

IMPORTANT DISTINCTION: PSI reports may include both:
- FINAL PSI REPORT OUTCOME (the official pass/fail status for the main inspection)
- INTERMEDIATE WIR STATUS (work inspection request flags like "Re-Inspection Required")

Use the FINAL PSI REPORT OUTCOME, not intermediate WIR statuses. Examples:
- If PSI says "Passed" but WIR has "Re-Inspection Required" → outcome is PASS (WIR was for initial inspection; PSI final is what matters)
- If PSI says "Confirmed" or no explicit fail stated, with no cancelled notation → outcome is PASS

Use these signals to determine outcome:

PASS:
  - The FINAL PSI summary/report explicitly states "PASS", "PASSED", "ACCEPTABLE", "APPROVED", "Confirmed", "Accepted", or similar, OR
  - Part 2 indicates the final inspection outcome is PASS, OR
  - Inspection report clearly describes work as complete, acceptable, meeting requirements with no outstanding deficiencies noted in the FINAL outcome
  - NOTE: Even if intermediate WIR had "Re-Inspection Required", if FINAL PSI outcome is PASS, use PASS

FAIL:
  - The FINAL PSI summary/report explicitly states "FAIL", "FAILED", "NOT COMPLETE", "INCOMPLETE", "Not approved", "Rejected", or similar, OR
  - Part 2 indicates the final inspection outcome is FAIL, OR
  - The FINAL inspection notes deficiencies or non-conformances that were NOT corrected

PARTIAL:
  - The FINAL PSI report explicitly states or clearly indicates mixed/partial approval (some areas pass, some fail), OR
  - The inspection was incomplete due to work not being ready, but work was partially inspected and some items passed while others couldn't be assessed

CANCELLED:
  - Inspection was cancelled, not performed, or did not occur
  - Document states "cancelled", "not ready", "work cancelled", "inspection cancelled", or similar
  - Part 2 indicates outcome is N/A because inspection was cancelled
  - Site was not ready for inspection

MEASUREMENT:
  - Document is an observation report without pass/fail criteria
  - Inspection documents conditions or progress but doesn't judge pass/fail
  - Data collection or documentation-only reports
  - Part 2 explicitly states no pass/fail criteria exist

OTHER:
  - Use when document doesn't clearly fit any of the above categories
  - Administrative documents, transmittals, or cover sheets without inspection results
  - Incomplete or corrupted reports where outcome cannot be determined
  - ALWAYS populate outcome_raw with the actual text describing the status/result from the document
  - This allows edge cases to be captured for later review rather than forced into wrong categories

IMPORTANT: CANCELLED is NOT the same as FAIL. Use CANCELLED when the inspection did not happen at all. Use FAIL when inspection occurred but work did not pass.

Standardization rules (IMPORTANT - follow exactly):
- Dates: ALWAYS use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2024-04-29", NOT "4/29/2024")
- failure_reason: ALWAYS null if outcome is PASS. Even if intermediate steps had deficiencies (WIR notes), if the FINAL outcome is PASS, this must be null
- reinspection_required: ALWAYS null or false if outcome is PASS. If final outcome is PASS, the inspection is complete and passed; don't carry over WIR "Re-Inspection Required" flags to the final outcome
- corrective_action: Use null if no corrective action mentioned (not "No", "None", or "N/A")
- reinspection_required: Use true, false, or null only (not strings)
- deficiency_count: Use integer or null only (not 0 if no deficiencies mentioned, use null)

Field mapping:
- report_date: The report date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- inspection_type: Type of inspection (e.g., "Paint Touch Up", "Framing", "Drywall", "MEP")
- location: All location information as a single string
- summary: Brief summary of the inspection and findings
- outcome: "PASS", "FAIL", "PARTIAL", "CANCELLED", "MEASUREMENT", or "OTHER"
- outcome_raw: Original outcome text from document (required if OTHER, optional otherwise for uncertain cases)
- failure_reason: Quote the reason for failure if stated
- issues: Array of {description, severity} for each deficiency found
- parties_involved: Array of {name, role} for inspector, contractor, subcontractor, trade
- reinspection_required: true/false if stated, null if not mentioned
- corrective_action: Any corrective actions noted
- deficiency_count: Number of deficiencies if specified
