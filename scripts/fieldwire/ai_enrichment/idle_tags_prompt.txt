Analyze construction site field observations and identify any idle time issues.

For each observation, extract tags indicating idle time or productivity issues observed. Only tag issues that are explicitly described - do not infer issues that aren't clearly stated.

## Tag Definitions

- **passive**: Workers present but not actively engaged in productive work (standing around, watching, minimal activity)
- **standing**: Workers observed standing idle, not performing tasks
- **not_started**: Work has not started, no manpower present, area empty when work was expected
- **obstruction**: Work blocked by physical obstructions, other trades, materials in the way, access issues
- **phone**: Workers using phones instead of working
- **waiting**: Workers waiting for materials, instructions, equipment, inspections, or other dependencies
- **permit**: Work delayed due to permit issues, missing approvals, or regulatory holds
- **acting**: Simulating work activity, appearing busy without productive output
- **meeting**: Workers in meetings, discussions, or coordination activities instead of field work
- **talking**: Workers engaged in conversation instead of working
- **delay**: General delays mentioned, schedule impacts, work stoppage

## Rules

1. Only include tags for issues explicitly described in the observation
2. Return an empty array [] if the observation describes productive work with no issues
3. Multiple tags can apply to a single observation
4. Do not tag based on assumptions - only what is clearly stated

## Field Observations:
{rows}

Return a JSON object mapping each observation ID to its tags.
